    1) spaces inside of the map ( we change the spaces inside of the wall by walls ?) [-]

    2) validate the player poss is not (out-of-bounds) , find player poss + check if its out-of-bounds

    3) validate the texture files 

    4)

// 1) check top && buttom  
// 2) check empty spaces 
// 3) check player poss if its out of band 
// 4) with in bound , this is good for checking if space is inside of the map or outside 


/*
	1) Check that the map contains only valid characters [-]
	2) Check that the map has exactly one player start position (N, S, E, or W) [-]
	3) Check that the map is fully enclosed (closed by walls)  [-]
	4) Check that no walkable area or player start is out-of-bounds [-]
	5) Check that the player can actually move [-]
	6) Optionally, check for empty lines or gaps inside the map [-]
	7) Calculate and store map dimensions (width, height, rows, columns) [-]
    8) after validation we conver the map to ints [-]
	/**********BONUS PART**************/
	9) check for texture file  [-]
	11) clean code - less functions [x] 
	12) norminatte [-]
	13) memory leaks [-]
	14) check for texture extention [-]
